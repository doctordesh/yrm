/This is a learning project, it's not suitable for any level of production/ use!

* How to use it

#+BEGIN_SRC go
import "github.com/doctordesh/yrm"

...

var err error
var m map[string]interface{}

m, err = yrm.ParseFile("config.yrm")
m, err = yrm.Parse(`a_string: 5\nwith: "values"`)
// if err
m["a_string"] == 5    // true
m["with"] == "values" // true
#+END_SRC


* Background

I wanted to understand how lexers and parser worked. Instead of taking on the
huge project it is to create a programming language, I tried to come up with
other things that also needs a reasoable level of parsing. A custom data format
came to mind. YAML is the (syntactically) simplest one I found and I just
thought that maybe I can re-implement some of the features as a proper lexer and
parser.
